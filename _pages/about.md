I am a postdoctoral research associate in theoretical nuclear physics at Yale University, working in the Alhassid Group.
My research topic focus on the study of atomic nuclei, collections of microscopic particles called protons and neutrons, and interacting with each other in a complex way.
The atomic nucleus is at the core of all visible matter and comprises 99.99\% of its mass. 
Its relevance spans dimensions from ${ { 10 }^{ -15 } }$m (the proton radius) to objects as large as stars, and covers the evolutionary history of the universe from fractions of a second after the Big Bang to today, 13.8 billion years later.
The physics of nuclei is fundamental to our understanding of the universe and, at the same time, interwined in the fabric of our lives through the power of nuclear fission and nonproliferation issues.

%From the hot dense soup of quarks and gluons in the first microseconds after the Big Bang, through the formation of protons and neutrons beginning the evolution of the chemical elements, to the awesome power of nuclear fission, bringing both strength and complicated nonproliferation issues to our national security, the physics of nuclei is fundamental to our understanding of the universe and, at the same time, interwined in the fabric of our lives.

%I study atomic nuclei, the core of matter and the fuel of stars.
%These quantum systems are self-bound collections of protons and neutrons (nucleons) that interact through forces that have their origin in quantum chromo-dynamics. 
%Nuclei comprise 99.9\% of all baryonic matter in the Universe. 

\section*{The Main Questions}

The complex nature of the nuclear forces among protons and neutrons yields a diverse and unique variety of nuclear phenomena, which form the basis for the experimental and theoretical studies. 
The long-standing goal of nuclear physics is to develop a comprehensive description of all nuclei.
This requires theoretical and experimental investigations of atomic nuclei, especially the rare and exotic ones, i.e. systems with neutron-to-proton ratios larger and smaller than those naturally occurring on earth. 
Key scientific themes that are being addressed by nuclear physics research are captured by four overarching questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How did visible matter come into being and how does it evolve?
  \item How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge?
  \item Are the fundamental interactions that are basic to the structure of matter fully understood?
  \item How can the knowledge and technological progress provided by nuclear physics best be used to benefit society?
\end{itemize}


\section*{What Do I Do ?}
My professional activity is centered on the theoretical description of atomic nuclei, with a focus on those short-lived, exotic nuclei that inhabit remote regions of the nuclear landscape. 
This scientific research invites a strong interaction between nuclear physics, quantum many-body problem, and high performance computing.
I specialise in the developement, both theoretical and numerical, of miscroscopic approaches to nuclear reactions, commonly refered as unifying nuclear structure and reactions.
